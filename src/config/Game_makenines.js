				type: "p",
				text: "The idea for 'makenines' came to Ashley in a dream during the Christmas and New Year holidays. Originally based on the premature joke \"Why doesn't 6 like 7? ...because 7 ate 9!\", the main mechanic was to arrange 7s, 8s and 9s on a grid so that no 6s were adjacent to 7s. It later dream-morphed into making / resolving 9s from the grid. 9 <i>was</i> eaten by 7, afterall. Later that day, in roughly 9 hours, a 'makenines' prototype was born."
