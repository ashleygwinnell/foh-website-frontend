Force Of Habit is an independent games studio by Ashley Gwinnell.<br/><br/>

#### HISTORY: 2012 - 2016

Ashley Gwinnell met Nick Dymond (former co-founder) at a small game jam event in Bristol. After their demo placed second in the [Extended Play Festival](http://explay.co.uk/) that year, they returned as a team to participate in the Global Game Jam and developed atmospheric input-recycler _[Omnivium](http://gamejolt.com/games/omnivium/8623)_.

With similar interests discovered in audio-oriented and experimental game design, they continued working together in game jams, continually raising the bar on what they could achieve in short bursts of time. After Ashley finished his degree in Computer Science, Nick quit his job and Force Of Habit was born.

Nick and Ashley worked on multiple titles including their debut, cult-hit [Toast Time](http://toasttime.co.uk) ([Android](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=org.forceofhabit.toasttime), [iOS](https://itunes.apple.com/gb/app/toast-time/id722232991)), Neon Caves, Sinking Feeling, [Friendship Club](http://timmybibble.com), and many other prototypes and work-for-hire projects.<br/><br/>

#### HISTORY: 2016 - CURRENT

In January 2016 Nick left Force Of Habit in the capable hands of Ashley to embark on his own, curious, solo adventure. What's Nick up to now? Well, you'd have to [ask him](http://monomoon.co.uk)!

Now, when Ashley isn't filling his face with bread-based carbohydrates, he's continuing with [experimentation](/games) in game jams, steadily releasing small titles such as [makenines](/press/makenines), updating the back catalogue to new platforms (e.g. Nintendo Switch), and working on freelance game and web projects. <br/><br/>
